# Talking with Francesco - The 100 Interviews Challenge Gallery

This repository contains the code for the "Talking with Francesco" video gallery, a single-page website celebrating the "100 Interviews in 100 Days" YouTube challenge.

About The Project
This project was created to be a simple, clean, and visually impressive showcase for the first 101 interviews from my personal challenge. The goal was to create a "wall of content" that highlights the scale of the achievement and allows visitors to easily browse and watch the episodes.

The page is built with a single index.html file, making it lightweight and incredibly easy to deploy on any static hosting service.
